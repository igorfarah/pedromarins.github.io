I choose my own path. I stay true to myself and to my values. I experiment with choices. I might be afraid, but I don’t let fear stop me from trying new things. I can only live a meaningful life if I keep making choices and moving forward, pushing past my fears and testing my limits.


The world rewards people who try things and come up with new ways of doing business.
<!-- A vida não é de graça. Não adianta esperar que o universo vai te entregar alguma coisa de bandeja. -->

A large part of choosing your path is figuring out which values will determine your worth. Once that’s clear, it’s much easier to decide if the work you’re doing will increase or decrease your feelings of worth.

Work means offering a valuable product or service – and that work has to inspire people to pay you for it.

How would you approach something if you had never seen or thought about it before? A beginner’s mind acknowledges that you don’t know everything and still have more to learn.


People are drawn to leaders because they’re true to who they are and what they value. Their uniqueness is magnetic.


In any situation, whether it’s a meeting at a huge corporation or a coffee shop get-together with a fellow solo entrepreneur, I let my personality (with all its flaws) shine through.


I realized that money wasn’t a valid goal for me when I didn’t feel more accomplished by getting more of it.


A funny thing happens when you focus on work that you love; more soon starts to appear. Like attracts like. Plus, that intersection between enjoying what you do and getting paid to do it is the sweetest place of all.


Challenging myself and pushing against my fears are two of my core values, and that won’t happen if I’m endlessly building client websites. If I don’t try new things and new directions, I feel like I’ll stagnate.
<!-- Caralho. Isso bateu comigo. -->

Meaningful work is like a drug – and just like drugs, you eventually become immune to their effects and need to up the dosage just to the feel the same high. I needed to up my meaningful work dosage.
<!-- Excelente argumento de vendas para o curso. -->

Most reasons to delay are invalid if you get right to the core: no time, no money, no audience. These are all future concerns, which make it hard to start anything. Worry about those things later or not at all. Make small decisions at first, and start moving in a direction that feels right.


You have to change your paradigm from consumption to creation. Then the possibilities are limitless.


asked why he didn’t value life’s necessities. James replied that he did, but he didn’t want his gravestone to say, “Here lies James. He paid his rent.

We have no idea what we can really do unless we try things and challenge our perceived limits.


The more you worry about missing out on things, the more of your actual life is consumed by worrying about what you’re missing.
<!-- Confuso paradigma que eu nunca parei para analisar. -->


Dr. Brené Brown (watch her 2010 TED talk) has studied vulnerability for over a decade.


When you're solving someone's problems with your valued expertise, you're going to satisfy a lot of people. They'll tell others how you helped them, and you'll have more people asking for help. So help people. Start doing it right now.
<!-- Né? -->


Find the intersection where your interests meet your skills and reach an audience that'll pay for your time, work, products or services.


Who do you like to be around? How can your work help them? Who do you connect with naturally? Who feels closer to you, the more you share with them and reveal your honest thoughts?


Do you remember in medieval times (me neither, but stick with me) when you were in battle, possibly losing or confused, and then someone would hoist up your flag?
<!-- Note: trecho exceleete pra introduzir um texto Edit -->

So what's your rallying point? What does your flag look like when you raise it up – and who will be drawn toward it?


But then, inevitably, the passion fizzles out a bit. The work begins to actually feel like work. Maybe you even abandon the project, not in some grand gesture of deletion, but simply by working on it less and less until you forget it even existed.
<!-- Faço isso direto -->


As you start to develop your craft and expertise, you tend to have much more time and focus. So, it’s good to say “yes” to whatever work comes your way.


If you don't yet have an audience that values your opinion, you're actually in a wonderful place. Revel in the obscurity, because it means you’re free to try and fail without much attention.
